Hey there, I'm Mx. Jay Doe.

I am a non-binary developer starting to learn programming with almost no prior knowledge on this toppic.
My goal is to be able to learn enough to build myself a career in programming. I know that's a tall order, but it's something I am passionate about and I will do everything in my power to make happen.

I'll be collaborating on anything I can in an effort to not only increase my skill, but to further my knowledge by learning from example.

I hope that I can not only learn from this platform, but to also help people in along the way. : )
